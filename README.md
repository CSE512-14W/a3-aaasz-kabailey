## Project Name
Seattle 911 Emergency Calls
This is a an exploratory visualization for emergency 911 calls to the police,
and resultant incident characteristics such as location, response time, and type. 

## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here.  (Tell us how to open your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submissions can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:
Access our visualization at http://cse512-14w.github.io/a3-aaasz-kabailey/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

## Story Board

You can find a PDF of our storyboard [here](storyboard.pdf?raw=true)


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation
In the end, development proved a little too tricky for us to complete our full prototype as storyboarded above. We got the heat map working with the time slider, as well as a few more options for the heat map, but were unable to complete the full prototype we had envisioned. Our heat map and time slider are very similar to the storyboard. However, we ended up allowing people to change the scale on the slider, both for more detail on the map and the graph of total incidents. The filters were bypassed due to lack of time. 

We both met to discuss the preliminary design and the dataset mockup, as well as to explore the data in Tableau. Following that we (independently) created mockups, both working with the same idea. We explored both options for adjusting the time exploration and decided to go with one of the prototypes, which we then improved upon together.

Getting the brushing slider to work correctly was by far the longest process. Google maps and the heat map were relatively straightforward, but getting time selection and translating that into pointers in array (and in particular, doing it smoothly and efficiently) were much more difficult. A general lack of familiarity with the languages involved was also a major hindrance to our implementation: the flow of data was not always clear, and how to do error correction was also difficult.
